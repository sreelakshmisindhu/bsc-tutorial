\begin{frame}{Short Demo of Python}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      The interpreter: A simple way of testing things out
    \item
      Variables in Python
    \item
      Indentation or how I learned to stop worrying and love C++'s Semicolons
    \item
      Control flow: The ifs and loops of programming
    \item
      Using functions and classes in Python
    \item
      Multiple files and imports
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{center}
    \highl{Now:} It's your turn! We've prepared some exercises for you in the following. Try them out! \\[0.5\baselineskip]
    If anything is unclear or if you are stuck: Ask us. \\[0.5\baselineskip]
    Maybe also try using \texttt{git} to version control your code. That will also allow us to look at it together if you are stuck somewhere!
  \end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Python Virtual Environments}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    On \texttt{lxplus} (or most other clusters), you are presented with a certain selection of Python modules
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Load as follows (on \texttt{lxplus}): \\
        \quad \texttt{\$ setupATLAS; lsetup "python <your version>"}
      \item
        Look-up versions as discussed yesterday: \\
        \quad \texttt{\$ showVersions python}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    In general: OK, but often it would be nice to install some custom modules (e.g.\ \texttt{tensorflow} for Machine Learning), choose different versions (e.g.\ for \texttt{numpy}), or have multiple versions of Python for different purposes
  \item[$\Rightarrow$]
    Python virtual environments are your friend!
  \item
    For setting them up:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Create venv: \texttt{\$ python{3} -m venv <path/to/venv>}
      \item
        Activate venv: \texttt{\$ source <path/to/venv>/bin/activate} \\
        Notice how \texttt{(<venvname>)} should now be in front of your shell prompts!
      \item
        Add modules: \texttt{\$ pip install \{-U\} <module>} (\texttt{-U} for updates)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Try it out! Build yourself a Python3 venv with the following modules (for tomorrow/Friday!): \\
    \texttt{ruamel.yaml}, \texttt{matplotlib}, \texttt{uproot}, \texttt{pandas}, \texttt{tensorflow}, \texttt{scikit-learn}, \texttt{tables}, \texttt{pydot} \\
    \highl{But:} Start by updating \texttt{pip}: \texttt{\$ pip install -U pip}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Python Interpreter and Macros}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Open the python interpreter and print out `Hello World!'
  \item
    Now, do the same thing from a \texttt{macro.py} file
  \item
    Probably, you needed to use the following for the last task: \\
    \quad \texttt{\$  python macro.py} \\
    There is also another way involving a so-called \emph{shebang}. Try it out with that!
  \item
    Use your file to print out the integers 1 to 20
  \item
    Now only print the even integers from 1 to 20
  \item
    Can you store these integers in a file?
\end{enumerate}

\textit{Hints:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Python has a concept similar to the main-method in C++. Try the following for that: \\
    \quad \texttt{if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_":}
  \item
    To make a file executable with Linux, you also have to change it's permissions. For that you can use \texttt{chmod +x <executable>}
  \item
    Try out what the following command does in the interpreter: \\
    \quad \texttt{range(20)}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Python is a very user-friendly programming language
  \item
    Now used extensively for Data Science {\color{ugoelogodark}$\rightarrow$} Connection with C++ based \texttt{ROOT} via \texttt{uproot} module
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[$\hookrightarrow$]
        More about that tomorrow
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Of course we could only give you a very brief overview of Python. If you are stuck during your thesis, just look online for help or ask your friendly PhD student!
